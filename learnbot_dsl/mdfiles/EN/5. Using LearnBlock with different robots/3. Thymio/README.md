# Thymio

Using Thymio with LearnBlock requires for the installation of *gobject* and *aseba*. For Python3, *gobject* can be installed as follows:

    sudo pip3 install PyGObject

To install *aseba*, you can run the following command:

    sudo apt-get install aseba

Be sure that the dongle of the robot is properly attached to a USB port of your computer. Then run the following command on a terminal:

    sudo asebamedulla "ser:name=Thymio-II" 

After that you can run programs created with LearnBlock on the Thymio robot (see the section [Program execution](<hidepath>/EN/4. Program execution/README.html)).
