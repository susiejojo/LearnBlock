# Simulated EBO under RCIS

To used the simulated version of EBO, you will need to install [RoboComp](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp). Then, you can directly start the simulator using the option “Start EBO Simulator” of the menu “Robot Tools” of LearnBlock. Simulated scenes for EBO can be downloaded using the option “Download xmls” from the “Robot Tools” menu. Once the simulator is running, you can test programs created with LearnBlock in the simulated version of EBO (see the section [Program execution](<hidepath>/EN/4. Program execution/README.html)).
