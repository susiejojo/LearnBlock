# EV3

To use EV3 with LearnBlock you need to install *ev3dev* on your EV3 robot. The required steps for that can be found in [https://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/](https://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/).

For remote communication between your computer and the robot, you will need to install *RPyC* following the steps described in [https://ev3dev-lang.readthedocs.io/projects/python-ev3dev/en/stable/rpyc.html](https://ev3dev-lang.readthedocs.io/projects/python-ev3dev/en/stable/rpyc.html).

Be sure that both, the robot and your computer, are connected to the same wifi network. Then, run LearnBlock and, after adding the robot EV3 using the option “Add Robot”, click on the button “Configure Robot” and set the attribute “RobotIP” to the IP address displayed on the screen of the EV3 robot. Now, the robot is ready for running programs created from LearnBlock (see the section [Program execution](<hidepath>/EN/4. Program execution/README.html)).
