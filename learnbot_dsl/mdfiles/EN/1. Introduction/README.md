LearnBlock is an educational programming tool that has been designed to help children to learn programming concepts through robotics.
Robots can be programmed using different forms of programming:

 * Visual programming using blocks.
 * Textual programming using a simplified programming language (Block-Text).
 * Textual programming using Python.

LearnBlock is robot-agnostic, i.e., it can be used to program different robots. Currently, the following physical robots can be used with LearnBlock:

 * EBO
 * Cozmo
 * Thymio
 * EV3
 
 In addition, LearnBlock can be used to program simulated versions of EBO and EV3 under RCIS and V-REP, respectively.
