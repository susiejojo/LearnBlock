# Program execution

To run your program you have to select a specific robot from the combo box situated beside the button "Add robot". If the robot in which you want to run the program is not displayed in the list, you can try to add it pressing that button. If the robot is configurable, you can set its attributes using the button "Configure robot".

Once the robot has been selected, you can start the execution of the program pressing the button "Start". The image bellow shows the execution of the program of the previous image in the simulated EBO robot using the RCIS simulator.

 The program can be stopped when desired by pressing the button "Stop". It makes the program ends and stops the base of the robot to prevent it from any damage. The program execution can be resumed at any moment by clicking again on the "Start" button.
