# Code generation

Once the visual program has been created, you can generate the equivalent textual codes using the “Blocks to text” button or the corresponding option from the “Project” menu. The Block-Text and Python programs obtained from the block program can be visualized by clicking on the associated tabs.

 The Block-Text program is a textual representation of the block program. It basically includes statements extracted from the text of the blocks.

 The Python program is the final code executed by the robot. It is generated from the Block-Text program.

 You can modify both, Block-Text and Python programs, from the text editors where those programs are shown. The modified versions of these programs can be directly executed on the robot. In addition, you can load and save to file Block-Text and Python programs using the availabe "load" and "save" options of the "File" menu.
